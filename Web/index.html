<h1>The RMatlab Package</h1>

<p align="right">
<a href="RMatlab_0.2-5.tar.gz">RMatlab_0.2-5.tar.gz</a>
</p>

This is the early release of a bi-directional interface between the R
and Matlab languages.  fe The idea is that Matlab users can call R
functions as if they are regular Matlab functions without learning the
R language, and similarly R users can access Matlab functionality from
with the familiar R environment and syntax.

<p>

This is work with Bitao Liu at Davis. 


<h2>Download</h2>
R package source <a href="RMatlab_0.2-5.tar.gz">RMatlab_0.2-5.tar.gz</a>.

This currently only runs on Unix.  We are hoping that people that use
Matlab on either Windows or Mac OSX will help to develop the
configuration details for those systems.
